## Me

I never actually learned hacking, but it feels like a decent client-server relation understanding is enough to pwn a good amount of entusiasts projects. I've got into it since highschool playing with Charles, back then it was enough to craft a user request to hacc a VK game.

<br />
It's difficult to recall a particular hacc case, since a lot depends on the current
state of the website and its environment. If I'll be doing something like that later,
I'll probably follow it up with relevant write-ups.

## Stealing stuff w/ XSS

Basic steps to follow to be able to steal stuff with XSS:

1. Check for cookies not having `HttpOnly` — in this case sessions are stealable
2. Look for login/signup forms — Modal forms are especially vulnurable since they usually may pop-up on a content page, and content pages (e.g., blog posts) are the main target for XSS
3. A way to retrieve the sensitive data is to spin up a server w/ a GET endpoint persisting incoming payloads in _URL parameters_. The problem with POST/body payloads is CORS, yet _GET request path_ parameter will be recieved no matter if the request will be cancelled right after
